This code wasn't made to always correctly solve wordle but instead have the same idea as humans trying to solve wordle.

The process of my code solving wordle is first guessing the puzzle with the word SALET.
After guessing the word, the code processes the result and creates a word bank that consists of words that doesn't have grey results but does have green and yellow results.
After processing the word bank, the code randomly chooses a word from the word bank and types it out repeating the same process.
This process goes until the wordle is solved or six words are guessed incorrectly.

Instructions:
To run, you must have your wordle opened in your web browser with your tab in windowed mode full screen. Example: https://prnt.sc/v_BaUForfMxJ
This code is reliant on mouse clicks so if you want to run it to its full potential, you must have the 'S' key exposed. Example: https://prnt.sc/9tSitvvoHstc
